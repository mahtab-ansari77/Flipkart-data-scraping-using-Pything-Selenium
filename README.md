I have created a web scraping tool using Python and Selenium.

This program asks input from the user of his/her search term, like what do you want to scrap? If the user inputs "Laptop" it will search for the laptop in the search box and scrap data.

It will scrap data like: 
Product Name
Product Price
Product Actual MRP
Product Discount
Product Reviews
Etc.... 

There are 3 files. 
multiPages :-  to scrap data for multi-pages
newWindow:- to scrap data by opening a new tab
sameWindow:- to scrap data using the same tab
